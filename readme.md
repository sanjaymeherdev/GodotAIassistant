# Godot Assistant 🤖

**Bring AI directly into your Godot 4 editor.** Describe what you want in plain English and get back production-ready GDScript files, valid `.tscn` scene files, or instant answers to your Godot questions — all without leaving the editor.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 GDScript Generator
Describe a script in plain text and receive a complete, runnable `.gd` file. You can also open an existing script and ask the AI to modify or extend it. Save the output directly to your project with one click.

### 🏗️ Scene Generator
Generate valid Godot 4 `.tscn` scene files from a text description. The plugin automatically sanitizes the output to fix common AI formatting mistakes, ensuring scenes load correctly in your project.

### 💬 Chat Assistant
Ask anything about Godot 4: GDScript syntax, node structure, game logic, editor features, and more. The assistant keeps track of your conversation history within each session.
